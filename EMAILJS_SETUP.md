## üö® Important Notes

1. **EmailJS Free Tier**: 200 emails/month
   - If you exceed this, you'll need to upgrade
   - Monitor usage at: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/

2. **Data Storage**: All emails are stored in MongoDB first
   - Even if EmailJS fails, you won't lose any signups
   - You can always export to CSV and manually email users

3. **Email Delivery**: Emails are sent asynchronously
   - Form submission won't fail if email fails
   - Check backend logs if emails aren't being sent

4. **Testing**: Use your own email first to verify templates are working correctly

---

## üìù Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending?

1. Check backend logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log
   ```

2. Verify EmailJS credentials are correct in `.env`

3. Test EmailJS directly from their dashboard:
   - Go to Email Templates
   - Click "Test It" button on your template

### Invalid Email Address Error?

- Make sure the email format is correct
- Frontend validation should catch this, but backend validates too

### "You're already on the waitlist!" Error?

- This is expected for duplicate emails
- Check MongoDB to see existing entries:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8001/api/waitlist
  ```

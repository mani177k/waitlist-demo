## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending?

Check backend logs:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log | grep -i email
```

Look for:
- ✅ "Email sent successfully to:" - Good!
- ❌ "SMTP not configured" - Check .env file
- ❌ Authentication error - Verify Gmail app password

### Form Not Submitting?

1. Check frontend logs in browser console (F12)
2. Verify backend is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8001/api/
   ```
3. Check CORS settings (already configured)

### Can't Access MongoDB Data?

View all entries:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/waitlist
```

Or use MongoDB client:
```bash
mongosh mongodb://localhost:27017/test_database
db.waitlist.find().pretty()
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Gmail App Password**: Stored securely in `.env` file
   - Never commit this to git
   - Rotate periodically for security

2. **API Endpoints**: Currently open (no authentication)
   - Consider adding authentication before production
   - Rate limiting recommended to prevent spam

3. **Email Validation**: Both frontend and backend validation
   - Prevents invalid email formats
   - Duplicate prevention in database
